### The Problem 🤔
During my time teaching, I had to take attendance during zoom meetings. This can be time consuming and a bit confusing. I was also running into an issue of people coming into the lecture for the first 10 minutes or so just to get marked as present and then leaving. 

### The Solution 🤩
This tracker can help you easily keep track of your students and also the amount of time that they were in the meeting. No more being tricked into thinking that your students were in the lesson the whole time 👀
